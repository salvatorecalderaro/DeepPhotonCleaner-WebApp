# DeepPhotonCleaner-WebApp
DeepPhotonCleaner (DPC) is a deep learning method that removes solar flare contamination from cosmic background signals. It uses an Autoencoder to detect clean segments of the signal, which then guide the cleaning process, preserving genuine astrophysical information while eliminating flare-contaminated parts.
